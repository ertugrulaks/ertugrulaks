Hey There,
  
   👋 Welcome My Github Profile.My name is Ertuğrul and I am a software student who is passionately dedicated to software development and coding.My first purpose here is improve myself on software.
   
  👀 I aim to develop and complete my own personal projects. These projects will provide opportunities to both improve my learning process and practice my software development skills.
  
 💞️ I enjoy contributing to open-source projects. Giving back to the community and enhancing projects is important to me. In line with this goal, I plan to contribute to more open-source projects.
  
  📫 I want to collaborate more within the GitHub community and work with developers who have different skills on projects. My goal is to bring different perspectives together to accomplish larger and more complex projects.
  
  🌱 It's important for me to stay updated on developments in the software development field and continually educate myself. Towards this goal, I plan to read books, take courses, and attend conferences to update my knowledge.
